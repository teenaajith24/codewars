Refactor the function into a recursive Fibonacci function that using a memoized data structure avoids the deficiencies of tree recursion Can you make it so the memoization cache is private to this function?
@cache = [0,1]
def fibonacci(n)
return @cache[n] if @cache[n]
@cache[n] = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
end
