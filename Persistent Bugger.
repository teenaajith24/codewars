Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example:
 persistence(39) # returns 3, because 3*9=27, 2*7=14, 1*4=4
                 # and 4 has only one digit

 persistence(999) # returns 4, because 9*9*9=729, 7*2*9=126,
                  # 1*2*6=12, and finally 1*2=2
                  
def persistence(n)
    # your code
    cnt = 0
  return 0  if n <10 
  while n >= 10
   n = n.digits.reduce(:*)  
   cnt += 1
  end  
  return cnt
end
