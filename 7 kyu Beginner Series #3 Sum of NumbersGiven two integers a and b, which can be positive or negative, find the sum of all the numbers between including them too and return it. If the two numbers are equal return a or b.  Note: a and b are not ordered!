Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

def get_sum(a,b)
  # Good Luck!
   if a == b
    return a
  else
   a,b = b,a if a > b  
    (a..b).to_a.reduce(:+)
  end
end
