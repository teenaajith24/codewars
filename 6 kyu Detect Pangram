A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.


def panagram?(string)
  # enter your code here
  alpha = ('a'..'z').to_a
  string.downcase!
  b = alpha.reject do |letter|
    string.split("").include? letter
  end
 b.empty? ? true : false
end
